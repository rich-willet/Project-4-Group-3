# Project-4-Group-3
This section of the project focuses on analyzing health indicators to predict heart disease risk using machine learning and data visualization techniques. After cleaning the dataset, we identified key health indicators contributing to heart disease risk using a Random Forest Classifier, analyzing feature importance to highlight factors such as BMI, age, and hypertension as critical predictors. To further explore the data, we applied K-means clustering with PCA to visualize distinct groups, identifying high-risk segments based on shared health characteristics. Visualizations, including a feature importance bar chart and a cluster scatter plot, were created using Plotly and saved as static images to provide an interactive view of these insights. This analysis provides a foundation for targeted health interventions aimed at individuals within higher-risk categories.
